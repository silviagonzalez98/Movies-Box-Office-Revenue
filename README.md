The objective of this project is to build a model that is able to predict the rating of products in e-commerce and to find out what its need to put together the ideal product for a e-commerce shop.

In order to do this, I used web scraping and made use of Python and Tableau.

### About the project
I worked with a dataset that I got from scraping the website of one of the leading beauty e-commerce companies in Europe.

I wanted to understand which attributes of beauty products drive customer ratings. Products are rated on a scale from 1 to 5 stars.

The goal of the classification project is to train a model to predict the rating of a product based on its attributes. The analysis is the base to identify gaps in the product range and therefore opportunities to create the next best-selling product for an e-commerce shop.

### Dataset
